BrowserLinux (made for web browsing)
----------------
[BrowserLinux](http://www.browserlinux.com/) is a lightweight and small distribution. Coming in around 93Mb, it is designed for browsing the web and... that's about it. In addition to either Google Chrome or Firefox, there are a few other utilities packed in there as well (Geany, Calculator, PDF-Viewer, Music Player).

Since it is based on PuppyLinux, there is the option to load the OS to RAM which makes it lightning fast. You can also install it directly to the hard disk. Try this distro at your own risk because, as far as I know, it is not supported or maintained. If you are curious to what a 93Mb OS can do, you may want to give BrowserLinux a try.

BunsenLabs Linux (formerly CrunchBang Linux)
----------------------------------------
[BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) is a minimalist Debian based operating system. It is a continuation of the former project CrunchBang Linux. In fact, many of the same developers that worked on CrunchBang are currently working on BunsenLabs. It offers a lightweight Openbox desktop with a simple and clean interface. Most everything in this system is customizable (though I find the OS great right "out-of-the-box").

I started using CrunchBang a few years ago and absolutely loved it. BunsenLabs is the perfect continuation for the project. I am very excited to see how things move forward with BunsenLabs and its team.

Lubuntu (Ubuntu + LXDE)
------------------------
[Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) is a fast and lightweight operating system built on the core of Ubuntu. No, you do not have to settle for Unity; Lubuntu is built using LXDE. This makes things much lighter and quicker. In addition to LXDE, there is a selection of preinstalled lightweight applications.

Lubuntu is user-friendly. I even have my non-techy parents using Lubuntu.
