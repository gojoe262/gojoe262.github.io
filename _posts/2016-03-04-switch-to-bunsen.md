BrowserLinux (made for web browsing)
----------------
[BrowserLinux](http://www.browserlinux.com/) is a lightweight and small distribution. Coming in around 93Mb, it is designed for browsing the web and... that's about it. In addition to either Google Chrome or Firefox, there are a few other utilities packed in there as well (Geany, Calculator, PDF-Viewer, Music Player).

Since it is based on PuppyLinux, there is the option to load the OS to RAM (which makes it lightning fast) or actually install the thing to a hard drive. As far as I know, it is not supported or maintained, so try at your own risk. If you are curious to what a 93Mb OS can do, you may want to give BrowserLinux a try.

BunsenLabs Linux (formerly CrunchBang Linux)
----------------------------------------
[BunsenLabs](https://www.bunsenlabs.org/) is a minimalist Debian based operating system. It is a continuation of the former project CrunchBang Linux. In fact, many of the same developers that worked on CrunchBang are currently working on BunsenLabs. It offers a lightweight Openbox desktop with a simple and clean interface. Most everything in this system is customizable (though I find the OS great right "out-of-the-box").

I started using CrunchBang a few years ago and absolutely loved it. I was sad to see it discontinued, but jumped at the first chance to get it back with BunsenLabs!

Lubuntu (Ubuntu + LXDE)
------------------------
[Lubuntu](http://lubuntu.net/) is a fast and lightweight operating system built on the core of Ubuntu. No, you do not have to settle for Unity; Lubuntu is built using LXDE. This makes things much lighter and quicker. In addition to LXDE, there is a selection of lightweight applications.
