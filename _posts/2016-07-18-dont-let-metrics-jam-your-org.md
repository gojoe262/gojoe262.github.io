Imagine you are the owner of the company called Fancy Breads. Fancy Breads is known for making high quality breads (obviously..) No other company even comes close in the quality. Your walls are lined with awards and gold trophies. "Hey everyone, come see how good my breads are!" Your breads consistently receive 5-stars ratings in various bread trade magazines. Your hard-work and attention to detail keeps customers eating, and more importantly shelling out loads of cash for bread.

Word spreads about Fancy Breads, and you soon start selling breads across the US and in 12 countries. The money comes in, and you continue to expand your operations. Despite your success, you struggle to keep up with the demand. In an effort to increase productivity, you decide to gather some metrics on your business. Every bread-maker in your company must now keep track of the number of loaves created: bread-per-hour. Employees with the highest rates get rewarded with more dough (bonuses and promotions). Those with the lowest... well, they've reach the end of their shelf-life.

This seems like a perfect way to up your bread output and keep up with demand. However, you notice that sales start to flatten, and customer review ratings drop. 1-star bread?!? What happened?!

You can see that giving workers the wrong incentive can lead to deviations from the core business. In this case, workers were sacrificing quality, a core concept of your company, in an effort to improve their bread-per-hour rate.  

### Danger of Metrics ###

It is important to pick an appropriate metric when selecting a measurement tool for employee feedback and process improvement. If the metric's goal doesn't fall in-line with the business's goal, you are giving your workers the wrong incentive. Your workers will work to improve a metric and not work to support the core of the company.

Metrics are becoming more and more popular in modern business. With the technology available nowadays, it is easy to measure everything under the sun. Be mindful when implementing different metrics in your organization. Don't create an environment where the goals of the employees don't support the core organization, otherwise your business is toast.
