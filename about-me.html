                        <h1>About Me</h1>
                        <p>Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me. Although I do not enjoy talking about myself that much, I will do my best so you have the chance to get to know me a little better. I am 22 years old and currently attending UW-Platteville. I have a great family that support me, and I love working on my various hobbies.</p>
                        <h2>Education</h2>
                        <p>I went to high school in Cedar Grove from 2008 to 2012. I was part of the school band. I played flute, percussion, and guitar.</p>
                        <p>I'm attending the University of Wisconsin - Platteville. I will graduate with a Computer Science degree in December 2015. I am extremely excited to be graduating one semester early. All that hard work wasn't for nothing.</p>
                        <h2>Hometown and Family</h2>
                        <p>I am from the little town of Cedar Grove, Wisconsin. It has population of roughly 2500 people. Friday night football games and going to church on Sundays are the norm around here. I still keep in touch with many of my best friends from there.</p>
                        <p>I have a great family consisting of Julieta (my mom), Roger (my dad), and Maria (my younger sister). We live on an old farm house, and this is where my dad also grew up. He used to help run the farm with his dad while also holding down a full time job in a factory. Although my dad's farming days are long past, he still enjoys maintaining his garden, heating the house with wood, and repairing things around the house. He also still works at the factory. We still hear the occasional story that usually begins with "Well, back in my day..."</p>
                        <p>My mom is from the Philippines. She first arrived in the U.S. in the winter of 1992. Going from tropical weather to a good ol’ Wisconsin winter must have been quite the surprise. Back in the Philippines, she was a school teacher. After a bit of time in the US, she went ahead and became a CNA. She now is working in a nursing home taking care of residents. </p>
                        <p>My sister, Maria, is about 1.5 years younger than me. We have been the best of siblings. I still remember the days of playing on the swingset together. Ah, simpler times. Currently, she is working on her Engineering degree at UW-Platteville.</p>
                        <h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2>
                        <p>I love playing the guitar. It was something I started back when I was 12 years old, and I continue today. Back in high school, my buddies and I formed a band: The Joe Schueller Band. We all had a great time doing this and even had the privilege to play at Summerfest. We still occasionally get together and play.</p>
                        <p>The <a href="http://pioneeric.weebly.com/">Pioneer Investment Club </a>is a campus group which manages a $500,000 portfolio. The club, which is led by students, meets once a week to discuss the portfolio, present our stock picks, and actually make investment purchases with real money. After seeing a need for an online presence, I created a website for the club. This soon turned into a new officer position: Chief Web Officer (CWO). I am responsible for web and graphic design, updating online financial documents, and writing articles.</p>
                        <p>I also like creating and working on my own projects. I’m currently working on <a href="http://www.github.com/gojoe262/LooseChange">Loose Change</a>. This is a web app. It will keep track of income and expenses. Front-end is using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Data storage is using Google Drive API.</p>
