We, as human race, now have some of the greatest opportunities.

Never before have we had such **fast global communication**
Never before have we had such **a large educated workforce**
Never before have we had such **diversity in thought**
Never before have we had such **an efficient global economy**
Never before have we had such **great scientific and technological advances**
Never before have we had such **great health and longevity**
Never before have we had such ...

But we also have some problems to deal with as well


Never before have we had such **a changing environment**
Never before have we had such **lack of drive and meaning**
Never before have we had such **large man-hours wasted**
Never before have we had such...


We have a great opportunity to change the world. It is literally sitting right in front of us. Are we going to let that opportunity pass through our hands, Or are we going to take hold and push society into the future?


Don't we want the future of humanity to look back at this time a great example of human potential? 
Don't we want the future of humanity to look back at at us and say, "Good job"? 
Don't we want the future of humanity to look back at at us and say, "They were doing it right."?
